# jAutomate

This repo provides a collection of tiny Java code snippets. It solves a bunch of day-to-day problems that might otherwise become boring to human beings by leveraging computer's automation power.

## Installation
1. Have Java along with Maven installed. Also, an IDE is suggested.
2. Fork the code from this repo.
3. Choose a Java class and run it. Most Java classes here are standalone, meaning they do not depend on 3rd-party artifacts.
